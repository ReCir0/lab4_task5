# A wanderer game

There was a module ```main.py``` that needed a file with classes to work properly, so I created a file game.py.

The main concept of a game is to wander in different rooms, fight enemies and the games ends when you either kill all enemies or die

## Class Room

A class that created a room, also makes it linked to other rooms, sets a character and an item in that room and has some method to get information

## Class Enemy

Creates an enemy as an entity who has weekness methods to fight and talk

## Class Item

Creates an item that can be used on specific enemies and defeat them
